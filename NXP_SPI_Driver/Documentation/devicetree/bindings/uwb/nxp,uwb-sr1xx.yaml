title: Ultra Wide Band(UWB)driver support for NXP SR1XX SOCs family

description: The nxp-sr1xx driver works for the NXP SR1XX series of Ultra Wide
    Band devices namely, SR150 and SR100T devices, and uses UWB Controller Interface (UCI).
    The corresponding details are available in the FiRa Consortium Website.
    (https://www.firaconsortium.org/). More details on the SR1XX Family can be
    found at https://www.nxp.com/products/:UWB-TRIMENSION
